# World Population Analysis - CODECRAFT Internship Task 1

This project is a submission for the first task of the CODECRAFT Data Science Internship, completed by Akshara Shree.

## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze global population data from the World Bank. The analysis involves loading the dataset, cleaning it to focus on the most recent data (2023), and creating two key visualizations to understand population trends.

## üìä Visualizations

1.  **Top 10 Most Populous Countries:** A bar chart showcasing the 10 countries with the highest populations in 2023.
2.  **Population Distribution Histogram:** A histogram that illustrates the distribution of populations across all countries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language for the analysis.
* **Pandas:** Used for efficient data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
* **Matplotlib:** Used for creating the data visualizations.
* **Google Colab:** The interactive notebook environment used to run the code.
